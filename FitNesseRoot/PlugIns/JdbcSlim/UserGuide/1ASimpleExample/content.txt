Most Tests require three steps.
1. Preparing test data
2. Execution some business functions
3. Validating the impact on the test data

Lets assume we have a database with some information about people and a we need to test a business function that relocates a person into a new city.  

!3 1 Preparing test data

To avoid side effects we execute the test in a transaction
!|Script|SQLCommand|TransactionDatabase|
|open Connection                       |
|execute|begin transaction             |

To prepare test data two approaches are possible:
1.1 Inserting new data into a database
1.2 Finding suitable existing data in the database


In this examples we use the second approach and find the ID of users named Ben and Sarah which should move. 
We store the Id of the users in a Slim Symbol '$TestID' for future reference.

!| SQLCommand|TransactionDatabase|select ID, NAME from TestData where Name ='%NAME%'|
|ID?         |NAME                                                                  |
|$TestID1=   |Ben                                                                   |
|$TestID2=   |Sarah                                                                 |

Before we proceed we validate that Ben and Sarah still live in the old Cities: Denver and Paris

!| SQLCommand|TransactionDatabase|select City from TestData where ID ='%ID%'|
|ID          |CITY?                                                         |
|$TestID1    |Denver                                                        |
|$TestID2    |Paris                                                         |

!3 Execution some business functions

Here calls to your business code will go.
A simple update statement which can do the job is given below.
!|  SQLCommand|TransactionDatabase|update TestData set City='%NewCITY%' where ID ='%ID%'||
|ID           |NewCITY            |Count?                                                |
|$TestID1     |HongKong           |1                                                     |
|$TestID2     |Tokyo              |1                                                     |


!3 Validating the impact on the test data

Finally we check that Ben now lives in Hong Kong and Sarah in Tokyo

!| SQLCommand|TransactionDatabase|select City from TestData where ID ='%ID%'|
|ID          |CITY?                                                         |
|$TestID1    |HongKong                                                      |
|$TestID2    |Tokyo                                                         |

!3 Rollback the change to not impact future tests

!|Script|SQLCommand|TransactionDatabase|
|open Connection                       |
|execute|rollback                      |
|close Connection                      |

!4 Check that the rollback worked
!| SQLCommand|TransactionDatabase|select City from TestData where ID ='%ID%'|
|ID          |CITY?                                                         |
|$TestID1    |Denver                                                        |
|$TestID2    |Paris                                                         |
