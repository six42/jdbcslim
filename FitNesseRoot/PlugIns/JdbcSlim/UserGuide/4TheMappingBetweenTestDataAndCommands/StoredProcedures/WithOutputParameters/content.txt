!*> To avoid side effects we execute the test in a transaction
!|Script|SQLCommand|TransactionDatabase|
|open Connection                       |
|execute|begin transaction             |

!3 Calling a SP with '''call'''
H2 returns the result as recordset and not as value.
The recordset has no header name this is not usable.
For H2 it is better to use select and not call.

!*> Rollback the change to not impact future tests

!|Script|SQLCommand|TransactionDatabase|
|open Connection                       |
|execute|rollback                      |
|close Connection                      |

!4 Check that the rollback worked
