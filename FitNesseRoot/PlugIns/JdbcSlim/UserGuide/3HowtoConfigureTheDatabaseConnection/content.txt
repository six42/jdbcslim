To configure a JDBC connection 4 parameters are required:

* JDBC Class
* URL to the database
* login of a database user
* password of the database user


These 4 values can either be stored in a configuration file or on a wiki page inside a '''Define Properties''' fixture.
For the examples used in this manual the configuration looks as below:

!|Define Properties|DatabaseSetup                 |
|key               |value                         |
|jdbcDriver        |org.relique.jdbc.csv.CsvDriver|
|DBURL             |jdbc:relique:csv:${TestDbPath}|
|DBUSER            |na                            |
|DBPASSWORD        |na                            |


'''!-DatabaseSetup-!''' is the name of the configuration and is passed as the first parameter to the SQLCommand.
'''key''' and '''value''' are the header line. Below these lines the actual configuration starts.

The SQL code can also be stored in the configuration. The key is CMD. Below is again an example:

!|Define Properties|FindTestUserIDs                                   |
|key               |value                                             |
|.include          |DatabaseSetup                                     |
|cmd               |select ID, NAME from TestData where Name ='%NAME%'|


Further make sure that the java classpath of the slim client contains the jar with the JDBC class.
