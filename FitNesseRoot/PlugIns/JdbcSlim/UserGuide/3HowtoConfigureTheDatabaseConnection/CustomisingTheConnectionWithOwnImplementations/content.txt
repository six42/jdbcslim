If your application under test already creates a database connection and you want or must use it also in FitNesse tests than this can be done.
You might also want to use this feature if your connection would require further parameters.

Just create an object from java.sql.Connection via a FitNesse Script and assign it to a FitNesse Symbol.
than call addConnection from SQLCommand  in a script and give the connection a name.
Use this name in future SQL configurations as DBConnection and your connection object will be used. 

Remember to close the connection once it is not required any more.
