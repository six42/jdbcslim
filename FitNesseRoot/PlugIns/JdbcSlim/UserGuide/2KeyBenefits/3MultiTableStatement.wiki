To prepare business data often more than one table must be updated or data inserted into multiple tables.
But for a business user this is often not important. Having said that the requirements should hide this technical detail.

This can be done with Jdbc Slim.  

!3 The technical implementation is moved into a Start Up and Tear Down page:

!include -c >SqlStartUp

!3 The business defines the requirements in a table 


!|Get the name and phone number for id|
|id       |name?        |phone?       |
|2        |Ben          |>0           |
|4        |Till         |>100         |
|3        |Tom          |>10          |
|2        |=~/Be/       |>5           |
  


!include -c >SqlTearDown
